# API Reference

While we recommend using [Apollo Studio](https://studio.apollographql.com/sandbox/explorer?endpoint=https%3A%2F%2Fgraphql.anilist.co) to explore the API, we also provide these reference pages for quickly finding information.

These pages are manually generated and may not always be up to date.

::: warning
There is a known issue where Scalar types do not get generated. Links for these types will lead to a 404 page.
