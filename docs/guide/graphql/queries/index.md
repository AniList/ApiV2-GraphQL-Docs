# Queries

While the API is designed to be very straightforward, it helps to have some examples to get started. These are not meant to be copied directly, but rather serve as inspiration for your own queries.

It is still highly recommended that you browse through the schema to see what fields are available. You can use the [Apollo Studio](https://studio.apollographql.com/sandbox/schema/reference) schema explorer to do this.

::: tip
None of the examples found in these examples include variables in the Apollo Studio links. You should make sure to set the variables as needed for each query.
