# What's Next?

Now that you've learned the basics of the AniList GraphQL API, you should try writing some queries on your own. You can use [Apollo Studio](https://studio.apollographql.com/sandbox/explorer?endpoint=https://graphql.anilist.co) to test your queries and mutations. It has a built-in schema explorer that will help you discover the available fields and types.

For inspiration, you can check out these places:

* [Query examples](/guide/graphql/queries/) right here on the docs
* A non-exhaustive list of unofficial community projects on [AniList's apps page](https://anilist.co/apps)
* The [`anilist` tag](https://github.com/topics/anilist) on GitHub

::: info 
If the project you have in mind requires user authentication, you should read our [authentication](/guide/auth/) and [mutation](mutations) docs.
