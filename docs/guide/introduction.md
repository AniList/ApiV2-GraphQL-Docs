# Introduction

AniList is an anime and manga database, tracking, and social site. Our [data teams](https://anilist.co/moderators) curate data for [10s of thousands of entries](https://anilist.co/site-stats) with the help of our community via [user submissions](https://submission-manual.anilist.co/).

## Accuracy above all

We only make use of data provided by [credible sources](https://submission-manual.anilist.co/anilist/Sourcing-626a4f0b0a27476483e041cd8ff8fde2): Production companies, licensors, animators, etc. If the information cannot be traced back to a valid source, we don't list it. 

## Public API

AniList provides a free, publicly accessible API. It is a slightly trimmed down version of the API used by the site itself. For more information, check out our [GraphQL Getting Started](/guide/graphql/) page.

::: warning Adult Content
AniList entries content may contain adult content. Please be aware of this when using the AniList API. See more [here](/guide/considerations#adult-content).
