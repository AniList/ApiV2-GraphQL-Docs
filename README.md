## AniList API Docs

The AniList [GraphQL](http://graphql.org/) API provides quick and powerful access to over 500k anime and manga entries, including character, staff, and live airing data. The [AniList](https://anilist.co) & [AniChart](http://anichart.net) websites themselves run on the API, so almost everything you can do on the sites, you can do via the API.
