Now you've learned how to query the AniList GraphQL Api, you should test writing your own queries using our [interactive GraphiQL editor](https://anilist.co/graphiql). All the available queries, fields and types are visible on the right side of the page.

You can also view our [API reference documentation](https://anilist.github.io/ApiV2-GraphQL-Docs/) for the same information without the live editor.

**If you plan on adding user authentication to your application you should also read the** [**Mutation**](https://anilist.gitbook.io/anilist-apiv2-docs/overview/graphql/mutations) **and** [**OAuth**](https://anilist.gitbook.io/anilist-apiv2-docs/overview/oauth) **docs.**
